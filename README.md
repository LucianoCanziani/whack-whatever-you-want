# Whack Whatever you Want

Inspired by the whack the mole game. I present you whack whatever you want. In this game, you will be able to upload any photo that you wanna whack and replace the mole with it.

This project is part of the "30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge" and I gave it my personal touch by modifying it.
